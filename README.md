Undergraduate of Infromation Technology major <br><br>
Interested in weeb stuff (Anime, Manga, LN, VN, Anime themed game, you name it), gaming stuff (Laptop, and Android. Playing anything i interested in), and reading stuff (game lore, good books, and also ocassionally writing poems) <br>

Kazuki Fujimaru, inspired from Fate Grand/Order protagonist, namely Fujimaru Ritsuka. Kinda referencing how reading FGO story is the base point of my overall characters nowadays.
Kazuki itself come from MMORPG name i finally settle on after various iteration
Fujimaru itself picked to satisfy last name requirement. It's funny since Fujimaru could be interpreted as Fu, Ji, and Maru which conclude as F, G, and O.
Basically my nickname is just Kazuki FGO '<'
